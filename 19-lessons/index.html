<p>So far, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about details of teaching and learning.<br />
Yesterday we talked about specific teaching tools and how people learn; today 
we’ve talked about Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry teaching more specifically.<br />
So to wrap up the training, we’re going to go back and look a bit more at lessons - 
the actual content that you will be preparing and teaching as a 
Software/Data Carpentry instructor.  This will two forms: we’ll talk about 
lesson design generally, and about the Software and Data Carpentry lessons in particular.</p>

<h2 id="writing-lessons">Writing Lessons</h2>

<p>A theme you may have noticed in our material so far is a need to start 
“at the end”.  To write a multiple-choice question, you have to start with<br />
misconceptions and work backward to write a question to diagnose 
them.  To write a faded example, you start with the full example and remove 
pieces.  So here, the way to write a lesson is not to just sit down and 
start writing.  The most important thing 
is to know your audience and what you want them to learn, and then to 
develop your lesson accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="learner-profiles">Learner Profiles</h3>

<p>The first piece - your audience, can be identified in many ways.  Frequently 
people who are hosting a workshop have a specific audience in mind, 
based on their own experience.</p>

<p>One “creative” way to characterize the audience for a course is to write <em>learner profiles</em>.
This technique is borrowed from user interface design,
where short profiles of typical users are created
to help designers think about their audience’s needs,
and to give them a shorthand for talking about specific cases.</p>

<p>Learner profiles have three parts:
the person’s general background,
the problem they face,
and how the course will help them.
A learner profile for Software Carpentry might be:</p>

<blockquote class="quotation">
  <p>João is an agricultural engineer doing his masters in soil physics.
His programming experience is a first year programming course using C.
He was never able to use this low-level programming into his activities,
and never programmed after the first year.</p>

  <p>His work consists of evaluating physical properties of soil samples from different conditions.
Some of the soil properties are measured by an automated device that sends logs in a text format to his machine.
João has to open each file in Excel,
crop the first and last quarters of points,
and calculate an average.</p>

  <p>Software Carpentry will show João how to write shell scripts to count the lines and crop the right range for each file,
and how to use R to read these files and calculate the required statistics.
It will also show him how to put his programs and files under version control
so that he can re-run analyses and figure out which results may have been affected by changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="learner-profiles-1">Learner Profiles</h2>

  <p>Read <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/audience/">Software Carpentry’s learner profiles</a>
and then write one that describes a fictional colleague of your own.
Who are they,
what problems do they face,
and how will this training help them?
Try to be as specific as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="writing-learning-objectives">Writing Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>Summative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what they’re going to teach,
but in order to communicate that to learners and other instructors,
we should also write <em>learning objectives</em>. A 
learning objective is a single sentence describing what a learner will be 
able to do once they have sat through the lesson, in order to demonstrate 
“learning.”  That requires thinking critically about what exactly you want 
people to learn.</p>

<p>It’s dangerously easy to come up with fuzzy learning objectives.  A 
broad statement like “Understand git” could 
mean many different specific goals, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learners can revert a change to a file using git.</li>
  <li>Learners will name three benefits of using a version control system like git.</li>
  <li>Learners will compare the collaboration features of git and dropbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>What we want are specific, verifiable descriptions of what learners can do to demonstrate their learning.
Each learning objective should have <em>a measurable or verifiable verb</em> specifying what the learner will do,
and should specify the <em>criteria for acceptable performance</em>.</p>

<p>Writing these kinds of learning objectives may seem restrictive or limiting, but 
will make both you and your learners happier in the long run.  You will 
end up with clear guidelines for both your teaching and assessment, 
and your learners will appreciate the clear expectations.</p>

<p>In order to formulate good learning objectives we need to decide what kinds of learning we are aiming for.
There is a difference between knowing the atomic weight of fluorine
and understanding what elements it’s likely to bond with and why.
Similarly,
there’s a difference between being able to figure out why a microscope isn’t focusing properly
and being able to design a new microscope that focuses more easily.
What we need is a taxonomy of understanding
that is hierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural.</p>

<p>The best-known attempt to build one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy">Bloom’s taxonomy</a>,
which was first published in 1956.
More recent efforts are Wiggins and McTighe’s <em>facets of understanding</em>
and Fink’s taxonomy from his book
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Significant-Learning-Experiences-Integrated/dp/1118124251/">Creating Significant Learning Experiences</a></em>.
The table below compares them and shows some of the verbs typically used
in learning objectives written for each level.</p>

    <li>Identify the learning objective verb.</li>
    <li>Decide what type of learning outcome this applies to (i.e. comprehension, application, evaluation).</li>

    <li>Share the original and your re-worded learning objectives in the Etherpad.</li>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="reverse-instructional-design">Reverse Instructional Design</h2>

<p>Most people design courses as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The chair tells you that you have to teach something you haven’t thought about in ten years.</li>
  <li>You start writing slides to explain what you know about the subject.</li>
  <li>After two or three weeks, you make up an assignment based more or less on what you’ve taught so far.</li>
  <li>You repeat step 3 several times.</li>
  <li>You stay up ‘til the wee hours to make up a final exam.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a better way,
and to explain it,
we first need to explain how
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a></em> (TDD)
is used in software development.
When programmers are using TDD,
they don’t write software and then (possibly) write tests.
Instead,
they write the tests first,
then write just enough new software to make those tests pass,
and then clean up a bit.</p>

<p>TDD works because writing tests forces programmers to specify
exactly what they’re trying to accomplish and what “done” looks like.
It’s easy to be vague when using a human language like English or Korean;
it’s much harder to be vague in Python or R.</p>

<p>TDD also reduces the risk of endless polishing,
and increases the likelihood that tests will actually get written.
(Somehow, people always seem to run out of time…)
Finally,
writing the tests first reduces the risk of confirmation bias:
someone who hasn’t written a program is much more likely to be objective when testing it
than its original author.</p>

<p>A similar “backward” method works very well for lesson design.
As described in Wiggins and McTighe’s
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Expanded-Grant-Wiggins/dp/0131950843/">Understanding by Design</a></em>,
the method proceeds through four stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify what is worth learning (e.g., draw concept maps).</li>
  <li>Decide what constitutes evidence that learning has taken place
(i.e., create the final exam or some other summative assessment).</li>
  <li>Design practice work to prepare learners for what they will have to do during the summative assessment.
These should include formative assessments to be done in class
and the exercises to be done out of class.</li>
  <li>Sort those practices in order of increasing complexity
and then write short episodes to close the gap between what learners know and what they need to know
in order to do each one.
(An actual classroom lesson will then consist of several such episodes,
each building toward a quick formative assessment.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This <em>reverse instructional design</em> method helps keep teaching focused on its objectives.
It also ensures that learners don’t face anything on the final exam that the course hasn’t prepared them for.</p>

  <h2 id="how-and-why-to-fake-it">How and Why to Fake It</h2>

  <p>One of the most influential papers in the history of software engineering
was Parnas and Clements’ “<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940">A Rational Design Process: How and Why to Fake It</a>”
(<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/classes/121/IEEE86_Parnas_Clement.pdf">PDF</a>),
in which they pointed out that in real life we move back and forth between gathering requirements,
interface design,
programming,
and testing,
but when we write up our work
it’s important to describe it as if we did these steps one after another
so that other people can retrace our steps.
The same is true of lesson design:
while we may change our mind about what we want to teach
based on something that occurs to us while we’re writing an MCQ,
we want the notes we leave behind to present things in the order described above.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="discussion">
  <h2 id="teaching-to-the-test">Teaching to the Test</h2>

  <p>Is reverse instructional design “teaching to the test”?
I.e., does it steer teachers toward getting their students to pass an exam
rather than learn things?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
    <p>Reverse instructional design is <em>not</em> the same thing as “teaching to the test”.
When using RID, teachers set goals to aid in lesson design,
and may never actually give the final exam that they wrote.
In many school systems,
on the other hand,
an external authority defines assessment criteria for all learners,
regardless of their individual situations,
and the outcomes of those summative assessments directly affect the teachers’ pay and promotion.
Green’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393351084/">Building a Better Teacher</a></em> argues that this focus on measurement
is appealing to those with the power to set the tests,
but is unlikely to improve outcomes unless it is coupled with
support for teachers to make improvements based on test outcomes.
This is often missing,
because as Scott pointed out in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153/">Seeing Like a State</a></em>,
large organizations usually value uniformity over productivity.</p>

  <p>Carroll et al’s 1987 paper “<a href="../files/papers/carroll-minimal-manual-1987.pdf">The Minimal Manual</a>”
outlines an approach to documentation and instruction
in which each lesson is one page long and describes how to accomplish one concrete task.
Its focus on immediate application,
error recognition and recovery,
and reference use after training
makes it an interesting model for Software and Data Carpentry.</p>

<h2 id="software-and-data-carpentry-lessons">Software and Data Carpentry Lessons</h2>

<p>It would be nice to say that the Software and Data Carpentry lessons were all 
developed using perfect reverse instructional design.  While that’s not necessarily 
true, all of the lessons are constantly being revised and edited with certain 
core objectives in mind.</p>

<p>but these are less frequently used.</p>

<p>The main aim of the Unix shell lesson is to familiarize people with a handful of basic concepts
that crop up in many other areas of computing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the notions of a path and a home directory</li>
  <li>the use of history and tab completion to save time (and prevent mistakes)</li>
  <li>manipulating text using <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, and related tools</li>
  <li>combining existing tools using pipes instead of writing new ones</li>
  <li>using loops to repeat operations</li>
</ul>

<p>The aims of the version control lesson are to teach people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to keep track of their work,</li>
  <li>how to collaborate with other people online, and</li>
  <li>enough about privacy and licensing that they can begin to make sensible decisions about
what to put where and how to share it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ostensible aim of the programming lessons are to show people
how to build modular programs out of small functions
that can be read, tested, and re-used.
However,
these concepts turn out to be hard to convey to people
who are still learning the syntax of a programming language
(forest and trees),
so in practice the programming lessons focus primarily on
the mechanics of doing common operations in those languages.</p>

<h3 id="data-carpentry">Data Carpentry</h3>
